Graph Analysis with NetworkX and Matplotlib
This repository contains Python scripts for creating, visualizing, and analyzing various types of graphs using the networkx library along with matplotlib for visualization.

Overview
The repository includes different types of graph representations:

Graph with Weighted Edges: Demonstrating degree centrality and weighted degree centrality.
Directed Graph: In-degree and out-degree analysis.
Disconnected Graph Components: Handling disconnected components in a graph.
These scripts explore different graph properties such as centrality, degree, and connected components.

Features
Weighted Graph: Visualization of nodes and edges with weights.
Directed Graph: Handling in-degree and out-degree analysis.
Disconnected Components: Visualizing disconnected graph components with different colors.
